#  The method "isSupported(feature,version)" Tests whether the DOM implementation 
#  implements a specific feature and that feature is supported by this node. 
#  
#  Call the isSupported method on the document element node with a combination of features 
#  versions and versions as below.  Valid feature names are case insensitive and versions
#  "2.0", "1.0" and if the version is not specified, supporting any version of the feature
#  should return true.  Check if the value returned value was true.
