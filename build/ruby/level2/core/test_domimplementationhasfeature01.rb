#  The method "hasFeature(feature,version)" tests if the DOMImplementation implements
#  a specific feature and if so returns true.
#  
#  Call the hasFeature method on this DOMImplementation with a combination of features 
#  versions as below.  Valid feature names are case insensitive and versions "2.0", 
#  "1.0" and if the version is not specified, supporting any version of the feature
#  should return true.  Check if the value returned value was true.
