#     The "deleteData(offset,count)" method removes a range of 
#    characters from the node.  Delete data at the end 
#    of the character data.
#    
#    Retrieve the character data from the last child of the
#    first employee.  The "deleteData(offset,count)"
#    method is then called with offset=30 and count=5.
#    The method should delete the characters from position
#    30 thru position 35.  The new value of the character data
#    should be "1230 North Ave. Dallas, Texas".
