#     On successful invocation of the "deleteData(offset,count)"
#    method, the "getData()" and "getLength()" methods reflect
#    the changes. 
#    
#    Retrieve the character data from the last child of the
#    first employee.  The "deleteData(offset,count)"
#    method is then called with offset=30 and count=5.
#    The method should delete the characters from position
#    30 thru position 35.  The new value of the character data
#    should be "1230 North Ave. Dallas, Texas" which is
#    returned by the "getData()" method and "getLength()"
#    method should return 30".
