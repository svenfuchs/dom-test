# The "deleteData(offset,count)" method removes a range of
# characters from the node.  Delete data at the beginning
# of the character data.
# Retrieve the character data from the last child of the
# first employee.  The "deleteData(offset,count)"
# method is then called with offset=0 and count=16.
# The method should delete the characters from position
# 0 thru position 16.  The new value of the character data
# should be "Dallas, Texas 98551".
