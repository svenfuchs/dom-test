#     If the sum of the offset and count used in the        
#    "deleteData(offset,count) method is greater than the
#    length of the character data then all the characters
#    from the offset to the end of the data are deleted. 
#    
#    Retrieve the character data from the last child of the
#    first employee.  The "deleteData(offset,count)"
#    method is then called with offset=4 and count=50.
#    The method should delete the characters from position 4
#    to the end of the data since the offset+count(50+4)
#    is greater than the length of the character data(35).
#    The new value of the character data should be "1230".
